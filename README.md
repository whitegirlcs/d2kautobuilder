# d2kautobuilder

My English is not very good, the following is from Google Translate.
The essence of cheating lies in the opacity of information between players, not in the autobuilder.
There are only a few players in Dune, so there is no need to research anti-cheating tools like World of Warcraft.
Similar to 3Handicap vs 1Handicap, or H4 Balance, autobuilder balances the strengths of both players.
Otherwise, what's the point of always being Aisi 1vs1 kexy.
But when you use 3Handicap or H4 Balance, the other player knows it.
So we should solve how to know other player use autobuilder when your games.
Going back to the previous topic, there are very few players in Dune, so there is no need to deceive each other, it can only be maintained by trust.
For example I want to play to kipper 1v1 and use autobuilder, I can totally tell him that I will use it, That's not cheating.

AutoBuilder Guide:

In the instructional video, pressing F8 starts or stops recording video, and pressing Tab starts or stops the AutoBuild Program, which requires the D2K Program to be running and using the same resolution.

1. Basic Mode

My AutoBuild Program has two usage modes: Basic Mode and Custom Mode.
Basic Mode offers the most flexibility in usage.
Building unit essences involves constructing unit icons.
In this mode, all the units you want to build are stacked together.
To select a unit from the right build bar, simply move the mouse to the desired unit icon and press Q to add it to the stack.
To remove a unit from the stack, press W.
However, in this mode, the stack can only contain a maximum of three elements.
As a result, it is not possible to achieve a specific proportion, such as building missiles and sonic units.

This mode is commonly used at the beginning of the game when the buildings have not yet been formed.

2. Custom Mode

My AutoBuild Program has two usage modes: Basic Mode and Custom Mode.
More often than not, we need to use multiple heavy units simultaneously.
Basic Mode cannot fulfill this requirement.

In Custom Mode, you need to customize the unit template you want to build on the program panel.
For example, "1,3,7:1|8:4" means building only Infantry from icon 1, LightUnit from icon 3, and both HeavyUnits from icons 7 and 8, with a ratio of 1:4.
So, if you are using a resolution of 800×600 and the unit bar on the right is completed with icons 1-8 representing Troopers, Trike, Quad, Harvester, Combat, Missile, Siege, and Devastator, you will build Troopers and Quad units and build Siege and Devastator units in a ratio of 1:4.

This mode is useful when playing as the Atreides faction, as you cannot rely solely on a single HeavyUnit.

Note: Only resolutions of 800×600, 1024×768, and 1280×800 support Custom Mode.

3. AutoBuild Building

To build a specific building, move the mouse to the corresponding building icon and press A.
To stop building the selected building, press D.

4. Build Unit Delay

Do you want to use it to gain an advantage over your opponents? However, if your Infantry Efficiency is too high, your opponents will notice that you are cheating (and report you, leading to a potential ban for a month).
Consider setting the autobuild delay to mimic the behavior of a human player.

Three delay configurations are pre-set. Use Numpad 7, 8, or 9 to select the desired delay.
Additionally, you can customize your own delay on the program panel.

Note: Only Custom Mode can utilize the delay feature.

5. AutoBuild WindTrap and Refinery

In the late game, you typically only need to construct WindTraps and Refineries.
Pressing Numpad * will automatically build them.
If you require additional power, a Refinery will be constructed; otherwise, a WindTrap will be built.

To stop building these structures, press D.

Note: To use this feature, you must upgrade the Construction Yard and place Concrete_4 as the first building icon.

6. AutoClick Starport

Do you often forget to buy Starports?
You can press Numpad - occasionally to switch to the Starport panel.
You can configure this behavior on the program panel.

Note: It is not recommended to enable autobuy, as it may mistakenly click on a Carryall.

7. Random Order Build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRwL2TD28BY

When using Custom Mode and setting the ratio of Missile to Sonic units as 1:1, the program will alternate between building Missile and Sonic units.
Enabling this option allows for a probabilistic build order, resembling human behavior more closely.

Note: Random Order Build is only applicable in Custom Mode.

8. A Simple Example of Using AutoBuild

Finally, I have recorded a simple video demonstrating the usage of AutoBuild.

Please note that during the recording of this video, I injured a finger on my left hand, making the operations quite challenging.
Pay attention to the buttons to observe how I use them.
